# BellaBeat.CaseStudy
This case was presented by the Google Data Analytics course on Coursera. It was mainly about the habit of smart device usage in women, and the goal is to gain insight on how Bella Beat should promote and improve what they're providing for women's health-care based on a database extracted from Kaggle.

**A Brief Conclusion over the Results of this study:**

The results show us that there’s a clear trend in non-active people having a negative lifestyle,
The analysis on my hypothesis has led us to draw a few major conclusions:
 More activity will surely lead to more calories burnt.  More activity would lead to better health and lifestyle, is also increases the quality of sleep. (according to my last hypothesis)
 Non-active people would probably have a higher BMI
